== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin make my website accessible? =

Accessibility Checker will fix common accessibility problems, but it will not make your website 100% accessible. Despite what other plugins, integrations, or overlay products might tell you, there is **NO** way for any automated tool or plugin to ensure your website is fully accessible.

True accessibility can only be achieved through a combination of automated scans, manual review, and remediation of identified problems. Some accessibility problems may require you to switch plugins or hire a developer. If you don't have a developer and need help with accessibility remediation, we can help: [See our remediation plans.](https://equalizedigital.com/services/website-accessibility-remediation/)

= Is this an accessibility overlay or toolbar like AccessiBe, Userway, AudioEye, etc.? =

No. Accessibility Checker is a testing tool that scans for problems and presents reports in the admin dashboard. It has some intelligently designed fixes, but it doesn't add any overlays, toolbars, or widgets to the front end of your website. It will not use JavaScript to modify how screen reader and other assistive technology users are able to engage with your website.

Accessibility Checker is the kind of accessibility tool that accessibility consultants and people with disability support - one that helps you identify issues so that you can make your website accessible the right way.

= Does Accessibility Checker scan all of my content? =

Accessibility Checker **Free** scans blog posts and pages, including the header, content area, sidebar, and footer on those pages. There is no limit to the number of pages or posts that you can scan with Accessibility Checker or the number of times any one page or post can be scanned. So, if your website only contains standard posts and pages, then YES, Accessibility Checker will scan all of your content. If you have custom post types (such as a portfolio, team member pages, or WooCommerce products), the free version of the plugin will not scan these post types.

For bulk full-site scanning or to check custom post types for accessibility, please upgrade to [Accessibility Checker Pro](https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker).

= How do I know how to fix accessibility problems on my website? =

Every error and warning in Accessibility Checker has an 'i' icon to the right of the error or warning name on the details tab. If you click these 'i' icons, you'll be directed to a help article that clearly explains what the error or warning is, what its impact on accessibility is, and how to fix or resolve it.

Generally, these help articles will provide sufficient information to point you in the right direction, but if you still have questions, here are some ways to get help:

* Ask a question in our [WP Accessibility Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wordpress.accessibility).
* [Upgrade to a small business plan](https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker/pricing), which includes an onboarding call and bi-weekly office hours calls.
* Or, if you just want us to do it for you, [purchase a remediation plan.](https://equalizedigital.com/services/website-accessibility-remediation/)

= Can you help me fix accessibility problems on my website? =

Yes! If you need accessibility fixes custom-coded for your site, we offer website accessibility remediation to help bring your current site into compliance. [Learn more about Website Accessibility Remediation](https://equalizedigital.com/services/website-accessibility-remediation/)

= What if there are accessibility errors in my theme or a plugin that I cannot fix? =

If Accessibility Checker identifies errors in your theme or a plugin and you're not sure how to fix them, the best bet is to contact the theme or plugin developer for assistance. If that does not work, we can help.  There is more guidance about how to handle problems in your theme or plugins at:
* [What to do if a Plugin You’re Using has Accessibility Errors](https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker/errors-in-plugin/)
* [What to do if There are Accessibility Errors in Your Theme](https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker/errors-in-theme/)

= Will this slow down my website? =

Accessibility Checker was built with performance in mind and should not slow down your website. Unless you enable a fix, it does not load anything on the front end of your website for logged-out users. If you enable a fix, only the code necessary for that specific fix will load. In the editor, running a scan typically only takes fractions of a second.

= Do I have to connect to any third-party APIs? =

No, Accessibility Checker runs completely on your server and does not require you to connect to any external APIs or services for scans. This can save you thousands of dollars per year in accessibility scanning fees and is privacy-focused, ensuring that your website data stays completely under your control.
