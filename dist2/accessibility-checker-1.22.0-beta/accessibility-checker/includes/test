wp term create ac_rule "Image Missing Alternative Text" --slug=img_alt_missing --description="An Image Missing Alternative Text error means that your image does not have an alt attribute (<code>alt=\"\"</code>) contained in the image tag (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) at all. To fix an Image Missing Alternative Text error, you will need to add an alt tag to the image with appropriate text describing the purpose of the image in the page. If the image is decorative, the alt attribute can be empty, but the HTML <code>alt=\"\"</code> tag still needs to be present."
wp term create ac_rule "Image Empty Alternative Text" --slug=img_alt_empty --description="An Image Empty Alternative Text warning appears if you have an image with an alt attribute (<code>alt=\"\"</code>) that is empty. Alternative text tells people who cannot see what the images is and adds additional context to the post or page. It is only correct for alternative text to be empty if the image is purely decorative, like a border or decorative icon. To fix an Image Empty Alternative Text warning, you need to determine if the image is decorative or if adds something meaningful to the page. If it is not decorative, you need to add appropriate alternative text to describe the image's purpose. If the image is decorative, then you would leave the alternative text blank and “Ignore” the warning."
wp term create ac_rule "Linked Image Missing Alternative Text" --slug=img_linked_alt_missing --description="A Linked Image Missing Alternative Text error appears when an image that is linked to a URL does not have an alt attribute (<code>alt=\"\"</code>) in the image tag at all. Linked images must have accurate alternative text that describes where the link goes so that screen reader users know where the link is pointing. To resolve this error you need to add meaningful alt text to the image. Your alt text should describe the link purpose not what the image looks like."
wp term create ac_rule "Linked Image Empty Alternative Text" --slug=img_linked_alt_empty --description="A Linked Image Empty Alternative Text error appears when an image that is linked to a URL has an alt attribute (<code>alt=\"\"</code>) with nothing in it. Linked images must have accurate alternative text that describes where the link goes so that screen reader users know where the link is pointing. To resolve this error you need to add meaningful alt text to the image. Your alt text should describe the link purpose not what the image looks like."
wp term create ac_rule "Duplicate Alternative Text" --slug=img_alt_redundant --description="Duplicate Alternative Text warnings appear when the alternative text for an image on your post or page is identical to nearby or adjacent text, including the image’s title or caption. This warning also occurs if two images on the page have the same alternative text. To resolve this warning, you will need to change the text of either one or both elements that flagged the Duplicate Alternative Text warning, ensuring that all images have unique alt text and that you are not repeating your alt text in your image titles and captions."
wp term create ac_rule "Incorrect Heading Order" --slug=incorrect_heading_order --description="An Incorrect Heading Order error means your heading structure has skipped over a level. For example, if your page structure has a level 3 heading (<code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) under a level 1 heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>), an \"Incorrect Heading Order\" error will be flagged because there is no <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag between the H1 and H3. To fix incorrect heading order errors, you will need to either change the incorrect heading level to the correct heading level, or add content with the correct heading level in between the two already existing levels."
wp term create ac_rule "Empty Paragraph Tag" --slug=empty_paragraph_tag --description="An Empty Paragraph Tag warning means there is a paragraph tag present that does not contain content. These may be announced by screen readers or create confusion for users. To fix this warning, remove the empty paragraphs from the page. If you need to add spacing between sections, this should be done with padding, margins, or a spacer block."
wp term create ac_rule "iFrame Missing Title" --slug=iframe_missing_title --description="An iFrame Missing title error means that one or more of the iFrames on your post or page does not have an accessible title describing the contents of the iFrame. An iFrame title is an attribute that can be added to the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag to describe the contents of the frame to people using assistive technology. To fix a missing iFrame title, you will need to add a title or an aria-label attribute to the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag. The attribute should accurately describe the contents of the iFrame."
wp term create ac_rule "Missing Subheadings" --slug=missing_headings --description="A warning about missing headings means that your post or page does not contain any heading elements (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>–<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) within the content of the post or page body section, which can make it especially difficult for screen reader users to navigate through the content on the page. To fix a page with no headings, you will need to add heading elements. At a minimum, every page should have one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, which is typically the page title. Add additional subheadings as appropriate for your content. If you have determined that headings are definitely not needed on the page, then you can “Ignore” the warning."
