### Make Your Website Accessible with Accessibility Checker 

Equalize Digital's Accessibility Checker provides accessibility error and warning notifications right on your post and/or page edit screen. 

Accessibility Checker automatically scans your content each time you save a draft or hit publish, giving you real-time feedback on your post's or page's accessibility. Receive a visual overview of how your content stacks up against more than 40 different accessibility checks created to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 success criteria. 

For each error or warning flagged, Accessibility Checker lists the code that triggered the error or warning. Each item is identified as an error or warning depending upon its severity, so that you can prioritize your fixes. Thorough documentation is available to guide you on how to fix accessibility problems on your website and personalized accessibility remediation assistance and accessibility consulting is available if desired.

### Ensure Ongoing ADA, Section 508, AODA, & WCAG Compliance

For already accessible websites, Accessibility Checker is an excellent tool for ensuring ongoing compliance and accessibility. 

The in-page tests help content managers and contributors confirm they have entered their content in an accessible manner. There's no need to be an accessibility expert or memorize long lists of WCAG success criteria - Accessibility Checker provides an easy to understand accessibility checklist and reading level checks so that you can ensure you're not adding accessibility problems as new content is added. 

Content area scans are visible on each post's or page's edit screen as you type - no need to go elsewhere on your site to view results or visit a third-party website. These scans allow your team to create accessibile websites from the start, reducing the need for costly retroactive remediation.

### A Vital Part of Your WordPress Accessibility Strategy

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin make my website accessible? =

No. Despite what other plugins, integrations, or overlay products might tell you, there is **NO** way for any automated tool or plugin to ensure your website is fully accessible. True accessibility can only be achieved through a combination of automated scans and manual review, and if you read the 'fine print' for any of the accessibility overlays or plugins on the market, you'll see that they do not guarantee your website will be accessible.

Accessibility Checker does not make your website accessible, but it is a valuable tool to help you make your website accessible, the right way.

= Is this an accessibility overlay or tool bar like AccessiBe, Userway, AudioEye, etc.? =

No. Accessibility Checker is a testing tool that scans for problems and presents reports in the admin dashboard. It does not "fix" problems or add any overlays, toolbars, or widgets to the front end of your website. It will not use JavaScript to modify how screen reader and other assistive technology users are able to engage with your website.

Accessibility Checker is the kind of accessibility tool that accessibility consultants and people with disability support - one that helps you identify issues so that you can make your website accessible the right way.

= Does Accessibility Checker scan all of my content? =

Accessibility Checker Free scans blog posts and pages, including the header, content area, sidebar, and footer on those pages. There is no limit to the number of pages or posts that you can scan with Accessibility Checker or the number of times any one page or post can be scanned. So, if your website only contains standard posts and pages, then YES, Accessibility Checker will scan all of your content. If you have custom post types (such as a portfolio, team member pages, or WooCommerce products), the free version of the plugin will not scan these posts.

For bulk full-site scanning or to check custom post types for accessibility, please upgrade to [Accessibility Checker Pro](https:my.equalizedigital.com).

= How do I know how to fix accessibility problems on my website? =

Every error and warning in Accessibility Checker has an 'i' icon to the right of the error or warning name on the details tab. If you click these 'i' icons, you'll be directed to a help article that clearly explains what the error or warning is, what its impact on accessibility is, and how to fix or resolve it. Generally, these help articles will provide sufficient information to point you in the right direction, but if you still have questions, open a support ticket on WordPress.org and we'll do our best to help you.

= Can you help me fix accessibility problems on my website? =

Yes! If you need need accessibility fixes custom coded for your site, we offer website accessibility remediation to help bring your current site into compliance. [Learn more about Website Accessibility Remediation](https://equalizedigital.com/services/website-accessibility-remediation/)

= What if there are accessibility errors in my theme or a plugin that I cannot fix? =

If Accessibility Checker is identifying errors in your theme or a plugin and you're not sure how to fix them, the best bet is to reach out to the theme or plugin developer for assistance. If that does not work, we may be able to help.  There is more guidance about how to handle problems in your theme or plugins at:
* [What to do if a Plugin You’re Using has Accessibility Errors](https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker/errors-in-plugin/)
* [What to do if There are Accessibility Errors in Your Theme](https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker/errors-in-theme/)

= Will this slow down my website? =

Accessibility Checker does not load anything on the front end of your website so it has zero speed impact for your website visitors.

= Do I have to connect to any third-party APIs? =

No, Accessibility Checker runs completely on your server and does not require you to connect to any external APIs or services for scans. This can save you thousands of dollars per year in accessibility scanning fees and is privacy-focused, ensuring that your website data stays completely under your control.
