### Make Your Website Accessible with Accessibility Checker 

Accessibility Checker by Equalize Digital provides easy to understand accessibility error and warning notifications right on your post and/or page edit screen. 

Accessibility Checker automatically scans your content each time you save a draft or hit publish, giving you real-time feedback on your post's or page's accessibility. Receive a visual overview of how your content stacks up against more than 40 different accessibility checks created to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 success criteria. Each item is identified as an error or warning depending upon its severity, so that you can prioritize your fixes. For each error or warning flagged, Accessibility Checker lists the code that triggered the error or warning. Thorough documentation is available to guide you on how to fix accessibility problems on your website. 

### Ensure Ongoing ADA, Section 508, AODA, & WCAG Compliance

For already accessible websites, Accessibility Checker is an excellent tool for ensuring ongoing compliance and accessibility. The in-page test helps content managers and contributors confirm that they have entered their content in an accessible manner. No need to be an accessibility expert or memorize long lists of WCAG success criteria - Accessibility Checker provides an easy to understand accessibility checklist. Content area scans are visible on each post's or page's edit screen as you type - no need to go elsewhere on your site to view results or visit a third-party website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin make my website accessible? =

No. Despite what other plugins, integrations, or overlay products might tell you, there is **NO** way for any automated tool or plugin to ensure your website is fully accessible. True accessibility can only be achieved through a combination of automated scans and manual review, and if you read the 'fine print' for any of the accessibility overlays or plugins on the market, you'll see that they do not guarantee your website will be accessible.

Accessibility Checker does not make your website accessible, but it is a valuable tool to help you make your website accessible.

= Does Accessibility Checker scan all of my content? =

Accessibility Checker Free scans blog posts and pages, including the header, content area, sidebar, and footer on those pages. There is no limit to the number of pages or posts that you can scan with Accessibility Checker or the number of times any one page or post can be scanned. So, if your website only contains standard posts and pages, then YES, Accessibility Checker will scan all of your content. If you have custom post types (such as a portfolio, team member pages, or WooCommerce products), the free version of the plugin will not scan these posts.

For a full-site scan or to check custom post types for accessibility, please upgrade to [Accessibility Checker Pro](https:my.equalizedigital.com).

= How do I know how to fix accessibility problems on my website? =

Every error and warning in Accessibility Checker has an 'i' icon to the right of the error or warning name on the details tab. If you click these 'i' icons, you'll be directed to a help article that clearly explains what the error or warning is, what its impact on accessibility is, and how to fix or resolve it. Generally, these help articles will provide sufficient information to point you in the right direction, but if you still have questions, open a support ticket on WordPress.org and we'll do our best to help you.

If you need detailed consultation or custom coding assistance, we offer [Priority Support Packages](https://my.equalizedigital.com/priority-support/). These packages include email, phone, and Zoom support and are ideal for individuals or teams who need more hands-on assistance in resolving accessibility problems on their website.

= Can you help me fix accessibility problems on my website? =

Yes! If you need detailed guidance in how to resolve the identified problems in your theme or plugins or need accessibility fixes custom coded for your site, we offer Priority Support packages that provide this assistance. [Get Priority Support](https://my.equalizedigital.com/priority-support/)

= What if there are accessibility errors in my theme or a plugin that I cannot fix? =

If Accessibility Checker is identifying errors in your theme or a plugin and you're not sure how to fix them, the best bet is to reach out to the theme or plugin developer for assistance. If that does not work, we may be able to help.  There is more guidance about how to handle problems in your theme or plugins at:
