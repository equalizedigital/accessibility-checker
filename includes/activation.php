<h2><strong>Ongoing Efforts to Ensure Accessibility</strong></h2>
 
We follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1</a> as our guiding principle for determining accessibility. These are internationally agreed-upon standards that cover a wide range of recommendations and best practices for making content useable.

Website accessibility is an ongoing process. We continually test content and features for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and remediate any issues to ensure we meet or exceed the standards. Testing of our website is performed by our team members using industry-standard tools such as the <a href="https://a11ychecker.com/">Accessibility Checker WordPress Plugin</a>, color contrast analyzers, keyboard-only navigation techniques, and Flesch-Kincaid readability tests.<br /><br />
