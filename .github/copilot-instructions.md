# Copilot Instructions for Accessibility Checker

## Project Overview

This is a WordPress plugin called "Accessibility Checker" developed by Equalize Digital. The plugin provides in-post accessibility scanning and guidance to help users audit their websites for accessibility compliance before and after publishing content. It focuses on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance and does not require any API or per-page fees.

**Key Details:**
- Plugin Name: Accessibility Checker
- Minimum PHP: 7.4
- Text Domain: accessibility-checker
- Namespace: EqualizeDigital\AccessibilityChecker

## Architecture & Structure

### Core Plugin Structure
- **Main file**: `accessibility-checker.php` - Plugin bootstrap and constants
- **Admin classes**: Located in `/admin/` directory with class-based architecture
- **Core functionality**: Located in `/includes/` directory
- **Frontend assets**: Built files in `/build/`, source files in `/src/`
- **Language files**: Located in `/languages/` directory

### Coding Standards
- Follow WordPress coding standards (WPCS) in all php files
- Use PSR-4 autoloading with EqualizeDigital\AccessibilityChecker namespace
- Legacy files are autoloaded using EDAC namespace.
- Class names use `ClassNameConvention` (CamelCase)
- Legacy class names use `Class_Name_Convention` (WordPress style)
- File names use `ClassNameConvention.php` for new classes (CamelCase)
- Legacy file names use `class-class-name.php` (WordPress style)
- Use WordPress hooks and filters appropriately
- Use `edac_` prefix for custom hooks and filters

### PHP Guidelines
- Minimum PHP 7.4 compatibility
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow WordPress security best practices (sanitization, validation, nonces)
- Use WordPress database API (wpdb) for database operations
- Prefix all functions and classes with `edac_` when in global namespace

### WordPress Integration
- Use WordPress hooks (actions/filters) for extensibility
- Follow WordPress plugin development best practices
- Implement proper activation/deactivation hooks
- Use WordPress transients for caching
- Follow WordPress internationalization (i18n) practices

## Development Workflow

Never commit lock files (`composer.lock`, `package-lock.json`), even if they change when you install, unless you are adding new packages or updating packages. Always run `composer install` and `npm install` to get the latest dependencies.

Code should always be linted by phpcs and eslint before committing. Tests should be added for new functionality. Tests should also be added for any bug fixes. Use the following commands to run tests and linting:

```bash
npm run lint:php
npm run lint:js
npm run test:php
npm run test:jest
```

There are autofixers available for both PHP and JavaScript linting. Use the following commands to fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:php:fix
npm run lint:js:fix
```

### Complete Command Reference

### Docker Environment

PHP tests use Docker containers:
- **MySQL 5.7** (`db-phpunit`) - Database for WordPress testing
- **WordPress Testing Environment** (`phpunit`) - Custom container with WordPress + PHPUnit

### Troubleshooting Development Issues

- **Cypress Issues**: If Cypress download fails, run `npm config set ignore-scripts false && npm run postinstall`

- **PHP CodeSniffer**: Configuration in `phpcs.xml`
- **PHPStan**: Configuration in `phpstan.neon`
- **PHPUnit**: Test configuration in `phpunit.xml.dist`
- **ESLint**: JavaScript linting with `.eslintrc`

### Build Process
- **Webpack**: Frontend asset compilation via `webpack.config.js`
- **Composer**: PHP dependency management
- **NPM**: JavaScript dependency management

### Testing
- PHPUnit tests located in `/tests/phpunit` directory
- Jest tests for JavaScript in `/tests/jest/` directory.
- Use `npm run test:jest` for JavaScript tests
- Use `npm run test:php` for PHP unit tests
- Use `npm run test:php:coverage` for PHP unit tests with coverage report
- Use WordPress testing framework where applicable

## Accessibility Focus

- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Ensure proper color contrast

### Accessibility Patterns
- Implement proper focus management
- Provide alternative text for images
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure screen reader compatibility

## Key Components

### Scanner Engine

## Internationalization

- All user-facing text must be translatable
- Use `accessibility-checker` text domain
- Follow WordPress i18n best practices
- Support RTL languages where applicable
- Strings in javascript also need translation support using `wp.i18n` functions

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate and escape all outputs
- Use WordPress nonces for form submissions
- Follow WordPress security guidelines
- Implement proper capability checks

## Plugin Hooks & Filters

When adding new functionality:
- Provide appropriate hooks for extensibility
- Use descriptive hook names with `edac_` prefix
- Document all custom hooks in docblocks
- Consider backward compatibility


## When Working on This Codebase

1. **Always consider accessibility implications** of any changes
2. **Test with screen readers** when modifying frontend components
3. **Follow WordPress plugin guidelines** strictly
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing installations
5. **Document any new features** thoroughly
6. **Write tests** for new functionality
7. **Consider performance impact** of any changes

## Common Patterns

### Class Structure
```php
namespace EqualizeDigital\AccessibilityChecker;

class ExampleClass {
    public function __construct() {
        // never add actions right in the constructor
    }

    public function init() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Hook Implementation
```php
// Add filter with proper priority
add_filter( 'edac_custom_filter', [ $this, 'filter_callback' ], 10, 2 );

// Use descriptive hook names
do_action( 'edac_after_scan_complete', $post_id, $results );
```

### Error Handling, Code Review & Collaboration, and Performance Optimization
- Use WordPress error handling functions (e.g., WP_Error) for PHP errors.
- Log errors and warnings in a way that does not expose sensitive information.
- Gracefully handle JavaScript errors to avoid breaking accessibility features.
- Submit pull requests with clear descriptions and testing instructions.
- Tag accessibility-related changes for focused review.
- Use GitHub Actions workflows for automated linting and testing.
- Minimize DOM operations in JavaScript for frontend scanning.
- Avoid blocking queries in PHP, especially during scans.
- Profile and optimize accessibility scans for large posts/pages.

### Accessibility Testing Tools
- Use axe-core browser extension for manual accessibility checks.
- Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
- Validate color contrast with tools like Color Contrast Analyzer.

### Release Management
- Follow semantic versioning for plugin releases.
- Update changelog.txt and readme.txt for each release.
- Tag releases in GitHub and WordPress.org.

## Additional Guidance for Copilot and Contributors

### Documentation
- Use PHPDoc for all public classes, methods, and properties.
- Document custom hooks and filters with clear descriptions and parameter types.
- Update README.md and changelog.txt for any user-facing or API changes.
- Add inline comments for complex accessibility logic or non-obvious code.

### Testing Best Practices
- Write unit tests for new PHP functions and classes.
- Add integration tests for major features and accessibility rules.
- Use Jest for JavaScript unit tests and axe-core for accessibility assertions.
- Test with multiple browsers and assistive technologies.

### Accessibility-First Development
- Prioritize accessibility in UI/UX decisions and code reviews.
- Avoid introducing overlays or solutions that mask real accessibility issues.
- Prefer native HTML elements over custom widgets unless necessary.
- Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable by keyboard.

### Performance & Scalability
- Profile accessibility scans for large posts and optimize queries.
- Use batch processing for bulk scans to avoid timeouts.
- Cache scan results where possible, but always allow for manual refresh.

### Security & Privacy
- Never log or expose sensitive user data in error messages or debug output.
- Validate all AJAX requests and REST endpoints with nonces and capability checks.
- Escape all output, especially in admin screens and user-generated content.

### Release & Maintenance
- Use semantic versioning and tag releases in both GitHub and WordPress.org.
- Deprecate legacy code with clear docblocks and migration notes.
- Monitor for new WCAG updates and update rules as needed.
